Requisites
==========

As a web application, **collect** needs the following components :

- Web server : Apache and Nginx were used successfully
- PHP runtime : mod-php for Apache or PHP-FPM fastcgi (Apache/Nginx); even tested with HHVM, not the recently released 3.6 though.
- Database server : MySQL or MariaDB.

Under a linux ditribution, you can install all of them in one command line. Under Windows, you can try XAMPP, but I can't guarantee it will be working well.

Installation
============

Until further development, you need to manually create the database/user you'll use for **collect**, then import the collect.sql file to create the tables.

Then, copy the ``modele/config.inc.php.sample`` file to ``modele/config.inc.php`` and inside it, set the database address, name, user, password to use.

In this file you also need to define the "secret" password used to get access to modification actions : add, modify, remove a movie entry. By default just reading functions are available to anyone.

Additionnaly, if you want to make it more private, you can use the web server authentication mechanism (ie. through a ``.htaccess/.htpasswd`` couple for Apache) to protect access to the entire app.
